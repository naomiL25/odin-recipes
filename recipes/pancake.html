    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups complete pancake mix</li>
      <li>1 1/3 cups water, plus more as needed</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
      <li>8 pre-cooked sausage patties</li>
      <li>syrup for dipping</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine pancake mix and water in a bowl and stir until just blended
        (there may be a few lumps).
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat half of the butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat
        until melted.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dip half of the sausage patties in the batter until evenly coated and
        place in the skillet. Cook undisturbed until lightly browned and
        slightly puffed, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until the pancake is
        cooked through, 2 to 3 more minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Repeat with remaining batter and sausage. Serve with syrup if desired
        for dipping.
      </li>
    </ol>
