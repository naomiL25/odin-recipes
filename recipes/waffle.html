    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 Â½ cups flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
      <li>1 large Egg</li>
      <li>1/2 cup half-and-half</li>
      <li>cooking spray</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Whisk together flour, cornstarch, salt, baking powder, and baking soda
        in a bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk together egg, sugar, butter, and vanilla in a separate large bowl
        until mixture is smooth. Whisk in half-and-half and buttermilk. Add
        flour mixture; stir until just combined and a few lumps remain. (Do not
        overmix.) Chill, covered, at least 1 hour or up to overnight.

        remaining batter.
